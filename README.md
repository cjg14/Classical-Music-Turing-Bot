# Classical-Music-Turing-Bot
Are you tired of the classical music slander in this day of age? Want a buddy to discuss classical music with? This classical music know-it-all Turing bot might become your friend! Try conversing with them :)

Turing_bot: 
The Turing_bot is 'someone' you can talk about composers with. It contains a 'main memory' of some famous classical composers as well as some pieces they wrote.

NOTE:
    - to ask a question, please include '?' in your message at least once.
    - to get interesting responses about pieces and composers, you must include the name of the composer at least once. 
    The bot knows ...
        Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Debussy, Liszt, Mozart, Vivaldi
Features:
    - Can distinguish between question and statement and then figures out how to respond accordingly
        *Personally, I think a big giveaway in the identity of any chatbot lies in its ability to be able to distinguish a question and statement. If
        a person were to ask a question and receives a response in a form of another question...often that is a big give away of the chatbot's identity.
        - The bot will never respond with a question when being asked a question unless if it doesn't know what you are asking. If this happens, it'll probably
        ask you to talk more about it or just respond with something related to "I don't know what you are talking about"
    - Can recognize composers
        - When a message contains a composer's name, the bot recognizes the composer and will respond with something related to that specific composer 
        (perhaps a piece written by the composer, or a positive reaction to the composer)
        - Note: the chatbot is case insensitive! bEEThoVEn is the same as Beethoven 
    - Randomly generated details
        - to simulate randomness, the bot picks a set of descriptions, compliments, and reactions when responding
    - Starter Questions
        - If the bot is asked to speak first, it'll choose a random starter question
